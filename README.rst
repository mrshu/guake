Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Guake is a dropdown terminal made for the GNOME desktop
environment. Its style of window is based on an fps games, and one of
its goals is be easy to reach.

Guake is written mostly in python and has a little piece in C (global
hotkeys stuff). The code is placed in the src directory. Files and
images are in the data directory. Translation stuff is in the po directory.

ArchLinux
---------

Guake can be found in the [official repositories](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=guake) 
and installed by running

    sudo pacman -S guake

Compilation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are using an autotools based installation, so if you got the source
of guake from a release tarball, please do the following::

    $ git clone https://github.com/Guake/guake.git
    $ cd guake
    $ ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make
    $ sudo make install

If you receive a message asking you if you have installed
guake.schemas properly when launching guake, it means that your
default sysconfdir is different from the one chosen by autotools. To
fix that, you probably have to append the param `--sysconfdir=/etc' to
your `./configure' call, like this::

    $ ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc && make

If it is not enought you can install the gconf schemas
file by hand by doing the following::

    # GCONF_CONFIG_SOURCE="" gconftool-2 --makefile-install-rule data/guake.schemas

For more install details, please read the `INSTALL` file.

Git hook
~~~~~~~~

Please install this git hook if you want to beauty your patch before submission::

    $ cd guake
    $ ln -s git-hooks/post-commit .git/hooks/
